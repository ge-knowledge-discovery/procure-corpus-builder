The objective of this article is to estimate the influence of the hospital care system on lethality in metropolitan France during the inception of the COVID-19 epidemic, by analyzing the spatial variability of the hospital case-fatality rate (CFR) between French districts. In theory, the hospital age-standardized CFR should not display significant differences between districts, since hospital lethality depends on the virulence of the pathogen (the SARS-CoV-2 virus), the vulnerability of the population (mainly age-related), the healthcare system quality, and cases and deaths definition and the recording accuracy. We analyzed hospital data on COVID-19 hospitalizations, severity (admission to intensive care units for reanimation or endotracheal intubation) and mortality, from March 19 to May 8 corresponding to the first French lockdown. All rates were age-standardized to eliminate differences in districts age structure. The results show that the higher case-fatality rates observed by districts are mostly related to the level of morbidity. Time analysis shows that the case-fatality rate has decreased over time, globally and in almost all districts, showing an improvement in the management of severe patients during the epidemic. In conclusion, it appears that during the first critical phase of COVID-19 ramping epidemic in metropolitan France, the higher case-fatality rates were generally related to the higher level of hospitalization, then potentially related to the overload of healthcare system. Also, low hospitalization with high case-fatality rates were mostly found in districts with low population density, and could due to some limitation of the local healthcare access. However, the magnitude of this increase of case-fatality rate represents less than 10 per cent of the average case-fatality rate, and this variation is small compared to much greater variation across countries reported in the literature.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="13"/><table-count count="5"/><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The data underlying the results presented in the study are available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnees-hospitalieres-relatives-a-lepidemie-de-covid-19">www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnees-hospitalieres-relatives-a-lepidemie-de-covid-19</ext-link>.

Most studies on the lethality of COVID-19 seek to estimate the true lethality of the disease, an issue that has been addressed since the beginning of the epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0243606.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0243606.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The case-fatality rate is the ratio between the number of deaths due to the disease and the number of closed cases (i.e. recovered or dead). It is estimated by the healthcare system based on the reporting of these two values. The case-fatality rate should not be confused with the mortality rate, which is the ratio of the number of deaths to the total population, or also with the morbidity rate, which is the ratio of the number of cases to the total population. Mortality and morbidity rates depend on the extent of disease in a population, unlike case-fatality rates [<xref rid="pone.0243606.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The case-fatality rate of a disease in a population is an index of severity of the disease in that population, and of the capacity of the healthcare system to reduce mortality. In principle, this allows to compare the effectiveness of healthcare systems across regions or countries.</p><p>The aim of this article is to analyze the effectiveness of the healthcare system in France in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. This study also discusses the differences and the comparison on case-fatality rates published by the international agency by country (May 2020).</p><p>Lethality depends on the virulence of the virus but, unlike morbidity, it does not depend on its contagiousness. Virulence comes from the reproductive capacity of the virus in the cell, its capacity for cellular degradation, and its ability to induce or not an innate or specific immune response. Virulence is of purely biological origin and once the virus has entered the target cell where it will cause its pathogenic effect does no longer depends on environmental conditions outside the host. Virulence is independent of the host population but may change over time and space if there is a risk of natural mutation/selection of the pathogen [<xref rid="pone.0243606.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0243606.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Contagiousness characterizes the biological capacity of the virus to reach the target cell system of its host, and the ability to be transmitted from one individual to another. The efficiency of transmission depends largely on environmental conditions (e.g., climate, urbanization, population density, mobility), which can vary greatly from one country to another.</p><p>In addition to the virulence of the virus, the case-fatality rate depends on viral load, on biological risk factors and on population vulnerability (age structure, genetic factors, prevalence of co-morbidities, healthcare accessibility, etc.) as well as other factors related to the health system (equipment, capacity, staff, management, care of patients, effectiveness of therapies, patient management in a critical phase of the disease), and factors related to the detection and registration system for cases and deaths (clinical cases definition, detection, surveillance systems, case and death reporting). The evaluation of the case-fatality rate normally requires the detection and counting of all infected persons, irrespective of their level of symptoms (i.e. disease severity).</p><p>When the population risk factors and reporting systems are identical, case-fatality rate evaluation represents an excellent tool for analyzing, understanding and improving the overall performance of the health system, particularly at the level of hospital units. Studying the magnitude of differences in case-fatality rates between units also makes it possible to assess the impact of the quality of the health system on case-fatality.</p><p>There are large differences in the case-fatality rates of COVID-19 published by country (<xref rid="pone.0243606.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) or calculated directly from WHO data. These rates vary considerably, from less than 0.02 (Thailand, Australia, Chile) to more than 0.15 (France, Belgium, UK), with a mean at 0.04 and a standard deviation of 0.045 (WHO, May 8, 2020, <xref

pathogen (SARS-CoV-2 virus) is assumed to be identical in all countries. In order to compare case-fatality rates across regions or countries (and thus analyze the effectiveness of healthcare systems), it is necessary, when calculating rates, to standardize population-related risk factors and to use the same definitions and enumeration methods to record cases and deaths. This is not the case for the current pandemic and discrepancies exist among the country systems.</p><p>The principal objective of this article is not to estimate the actual lethality of COVID-19 in France based on the rates published by the health authorities, but to estimate the influence of the healthcare system on lethality by analyzing the spatial variability of the hospital case-fatality rate (confirmed hospitalized cases and hospital deaths) in metropolitan France between districts (i.e. French <italic>d&#x000e9;partements</italic>). This analysis, limited to metropolitan France, is possible while it remains within the framework of the same system for defining and counting cases and deaths. We thus assume that this system of definition and enumeration was identical throughout France during the period (19 March to 8 May) corresponding to the first wave (inception) of the COVID-19 epidemic in France. Therefore the study focuses on the extent of spatial differences in the case-fatality rate in metropolitan France, and enables to highlight the relative differences between districts, as well as to analyze the causes independently of the system of definition and enumeration of cases and deaths, and also independently of the main biological risk factor of severity (age) after standardization on this factor.</p><p>The other objective is to analyze the case-fatality rate observed in metropolitan France with the one calculated for other countries: the variability of the case-fatality rate between French districts (mainly due to patient management in the acute epidemic phase) allow us to estimate whether this observed variability can explain the significant differences in case-fatality rates observed between France and other countries.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Data and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Data</title><p>This study is based on daily hospitalization and death declaration data by district in France and is accessible on the &#x0201c;Sant&#x000e9; Publique France&#x0201d; website.

It gives in principle an indication of the severity of the patients in hospital. At district level, the hospitalization rate and this severity rate show a low negative correlation (r = -0.22), indicating a decrease in intensive care rate when the hospitalization rate is high. This trend may be due to the saturation of intensive care units. The relationship between hospitalization and severity could also be interpreted as a decrease in less severe hospitalizations in order to be able to manage more severe cases when the healthcare system is overloaded, which would result in an increase in lethality. Nevertheless, in both cases, there is no correlation between the severity rate and the case-fatality rate (r = -0.10), indicating that globally, the differences in use of resuscitative measures or endotracheal intubation does not impact the case-fatality rate. Finally, the severity rate does not have a spatial distribution corresponding to the spatial distribution of the hospitalization rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243606.g013">Fig 13</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0243606.g013" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0243606.g013</object-id><label>Fig 13</label><caption><title>Severity ratio during the COVID-19 epidemic in France for the period of time between March 19 to May 8, 2020.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0243606.g013"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Discussion</title><p>The standardized case-fatality rates at district level in France (0.04 for Tarn-et-Garonne to 0.26 for the Vosges district) remain in a ratio of 0.3 to 1.6 compared with the national average (mean 0.14, calculated by excluding districts under hospital stress in order not to take account of possible overloading of the healthcare systems). The relationships between standardized morbidity rates and standardized case-fatality rates in France show a correlation between these two indices, with an increase of SLR with hospitalization rate as shown in <xref rid="pone.0243606.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. It is therefore very likely that high medical admission rates and healthcare workers stress over the period under consideration has increased the hospital case-fatality rate: for the 20 districts with the highest hospitalization rates (essentially located in the Grand-Est and Ile-de-France regions), the average case-fatality rate is 20% higher than the average for all districts, and 25% higher than the average for all other districts alone. It is therefore likely that pressure on hospitals have increased the national average case-fatality rate by district from 0.145 to 0.153. It can thus be estimated that 2,425 deaths (out of the 16,732 deaths due to COVID-19 in hospital in France from 19 March to 8 May 2020, i.e. 15% of the total number of deaths) are due to the overload of the health system in the Grand-Est and Ile-de-France regions.</p><p>As we see, after standardization on age, lethality health risk factors (i.e. co-morbidities) do not show, at the district level, any significant correlation with differences in hospital lethality rates. With regard to behavioral risk factors associated to hospital lethality (e.g. late recourse to hospital care), studies focusing on mortality (i.e. not lethality) show significant differences in excess mortality according to the geographical origin of birth of the deceased [<xref rid="pone.0243606.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243606.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The authors of these studies attribute these differences in mortality to differences in the spatial distribution (the foreign-born population is more present in densely populated urban areas, like Ile-de-France region), and not to a risk factors for lethality which could be specific to this population.</p><p>There are clearly two risk profiles:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>the districts where a high rate of hospitalization is coupled with a high case-fatality rate. These districts correspond to the epicenters of the epidemic, are clustered, and include the densely populated areas of Ile-de-France.</p></list-item><list-item><p>the districts where a low rate of hospitalization is coupled with a high case-fatality rate. These districts are geographically dispersed, sparsely populated and mainly located in rural areas.</p></list-item></list><p>The first profile accounts for 60% of the patients (59,878 over 99,970). The case-fatality average for this profile is significantly higher (0.187) as compared with the other districts case-fatality average (0.138). The profile displays a 33% excess mortality, corresponding to 2,716 deaths (11,003 observed vs. 8,287 expected with the CFR 0.138). This excess mortality, corresponding to 16% of all deaths, is likely to be the result of increased lethality due to overloading of the healthcare system.</p><p>The second profile (more rural) accounts for only 12.5% of the patients (12,514 over 99,970), with an average case-fatality rate significantly high (0.178) corresponding to a 25% excess mortality (2,170 observed vs. 1,731 expected deaths), but of low magnitude. It is possible that this excess mortality is due to a lack of care (medical desert, poor hospital response), which would have led to an increase in hospital lethality.</p><p>Some districts in the south of France have both a very low rate of hospitalization and a very low case-fatality rate (Gironde, Dordogne, Gers, Pyr&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;es Orientales), as a result of a low circulation of the virus and an effective response of the health system. Another particular case, is the one of the Bouches-du-Rh&#x000f4;ne, which appears with a high hospitalization rate (1.96 per 1,000, for a national average of 1.27) and a low case-fatality rate (0.11 for the Bouches-du-Rh&#x000f4;ne for a national average per district of 0.15). This situation could be due to a medical policy of more active screening and earlier hospitalization of the infected in the district, particularly in Marseille metropolitan area. The high value of the hospitalization rate would then be more the result of a non-severe treatment of the infected than of a more active circulation of the virus in the region, as for the lower hospitalization rates in neighboring districts (0.9 for Var, 0.56 for Vaucluse, 0.52 for Gars, 0.86 for Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, 0.81 for Alpes-Maritimes, 0.68 for H&#x000e9;rault). However, patient severity profile (expressed as the ratio between the number of patients admitted to intensive care and the total number of patients hospitalized) is not particularly low in the Bouches-Du-Rh&#x000f4;ne (0.163 for a mean of 0.156 and a standard deviation of 0.06 for all the districts), and this hospitalization policy is therefore not proven to be the primary factor in the low observed case-fatality rate.</p><p>Time analysis shows that the case-fatality rate has decreased over time, globally and in almost all districts, showing an improvement in the management of severe patients during the epidemic. This decrease stabilized rapidly and no longer evolved, in a steady manner. However, this result is limited by the difficulty of calculating a case-fatality rate on aggregated data over a short period of time, with eventual death occurring several days after hospitalization. We chose to delay the calculation of the number of deaths by 12 days compared to the calculation of the number of hospitalizations, since 85% of deaths occur on an average of 13 days after hospitalization [<xref rid="pone.0243606.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>WHO data from 219 countries show a mean case-fatality rate of 0.041 (median 0.029, standard deviation 0.045) with values between 0.31 (Nicaragua) and 0.00 (for countries that did not report deaths until May 8, like Vietnam). Even if we consider only the average case-fatality rate calculated only for the French districts with the lowest hospitalization rates (thus not causing possible saturation of the healthcare system), the French CFR average is very significantly higher than the World average (and the rates of most European countries, such as Spain, 11.73, Greece, 5.52, Germany, 4.28, etc.) (<xref rid="pone.0243606.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The internal variability within France appears too low to explain the large differences in case-fatality rate between countries. These differences cannot be either explained by dissimilarities in morbidity between countries, in lethality risk factors between countries, or inpatient treatment, taking into account the quality of the healthcare system in France (<xref rid="pone.0243606.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). One can concluded that the difference between the case-fatality rate calculated with France datasets and the case-fatality rates presented using international WHO data is highly probably the result of a disparity in the registration of cases and/or deaths and not due to the quality of healthcare system or treatment. These differences in the counting of cases and/or deaths may be due to the hospitalization and screening policy specific to each country as well as the ability or willingness to hospitalize more non-severe forms, to the differences in case definition, or to insufficient quality of the health system for detecting and reporting cases and deaths. Such finding is reinforced by studies on excess mortality (difference to the average mortality of previous years over the same period) showing that in most countries, excess mortality is not fully explained by deaths officially attributed to COVID-19, while France datasets present a slight excess of COVID-19 reported deaths [<xref rid="pone.0243606.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec011"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that the higher case-fatality rates observed in France in some districts during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic (data from 19 March to 8 May 2020) are mostly linked to the level of morbidity in the district, and therefore likely to the congestion of the healthcare systems during the acute phases of the epidemic. When the hospitalization rate is low, high case-fatality rates concern rural districts with low population density and could be linked to healthcare access in these districts.</p><p>However, the increase in the standardized case-fatality rate due to exceptional situations during epidemic peaks represents less than 10% of the average case-fatality rate per district in France, and the hospital case-fatality rate without these districts would be reduced from 0.151 to 0.138. This increase cannot therefore explain the extent of the difference observed between the average case-fatality rate in France and the average of the rates reported for all countries by international organizations or information sites (WHO, Wordometer, etc.). These differences probably stem from the reporting of cases and deaths, which is uneven from one country to another, and not from the care or treatment of patients during hospital stress due to epidemic peaks.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0243606.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Morteza</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fakher</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>. <article-title>Cross-Country Comparison of Case Fatality Rates of COVID-19/SARS-COV-2</article-title>. <source>Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives</source>

The study concludes that the higher case fatality rates observed in France is linked to the level of morbidity in the district. The study has also suggested that the case-fatality rates (CFR) may be linked to the hospital care available in the district, i.e., higher congestion of the hospitals or lower accessibility of the hospital care leads to the higher CFR. The manuscript is well written, the introduction is quite informative and the data are well presented and may be interesting for readers from varying fields. However, there are few concerns may be clarified are given below:</p><p>1. The abstract does not fully explains the study and needs to mention more about the findings presented in the discussion and conclusion.</p><p>2. Higher hospitalization leads to higher CFR, this explains that it is directly related to the higher morbidity, however, to compare with the hospital care system authors need to present a data showing the number of hospital/ beds accessible (per 1000). As explained higher hospital stress means 3 or more per 1000 does not explain the availability or accessibility to hospital care. Table 3 shows the total hospitalized and CFR. Here authors may put a data comparing the hospital care accessibility.</p><p>3. Table 3 also should show the data of hospitalized and death (%) 11 and 44 regions. This will help the readers to have better clarity.</p><p>4. The higher CFR is among the age group 50 and above. Is the overall difference found between CFR whole and CFR without regions 11 and 44 is due to the presence of higher number of higher age group cases?</p><p>5. Table 4 shows that the CFR varies from 0.134 for districts with a low hospitalization rate (less than 0.5 per 1000) to 0.150 for districts with a high hospitalization rate (less than 4 per 1000). How the average for all the districts higher (0.152)? What is the meaning of districts number? What does &#x0201c;all&#x0201d; in the last line shows?</p><p>6. Figure 12 presents districts with different morbidity and the lethality. Can the authors compare the low morbidity high lethality vs. high morbidity high lethality districts? Is there any similarity/ differences related to hospitalization/ accessible to hospitals or the aging population in these districts? The CFR is high in the higher age groups. To justify that the CFR is higher in the districts having higher hospital stress or due to lack of hospital care, authors need to show and compare the CFR rates between different age groups. Is the CFR is higher due to the presence of higher %age of higher age groups?</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Comments to the Author</p><p>The authors show the increase in the case-fatality rate in France during epidemic peaks related to the level of morbidity, but not from the care or treatment of patients during hospital stress due to epidemic peaks. Although this paper was well written, I have several comments. Sufficient improvements for those issues are needed for the acceptance to the PLoS One.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1. I believe that morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 are strongly related to patient&#x02019;s factors including incidence of diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Please indicate the difference of these risk factor between France and other countries or regions in France, or if there is no data, please indicate as a limitation.</p><p>2&#x0ff0e;In our country, there are differences in the availability of infectious disease wards and the capacity to operate ECMO depending on the region. Please explain differences of these factors between France and other countries or regions in France, or if there is no data please explain in the discussions and limitations.</p><p>3. Criteria of severity of COVID-19 by admitting ICU or not depend on capacity of each facility, so I concern that it may be inappropriate as an indicator of the severity. I consider that there is no correlation between the severity rate and the case-fatality rate. I believe that endotracheal intubation is relatively good indicator of the severity of the disease. Is it possible to discuss the difference in the severity of cases according to this standard and the difference from other countries?</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;Souris et al present a very unique and interesting analysis of the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization in France, specifically analyzing hospital case-fatality rate to try to understand regional/geographic variations in healthcare. They report significant variations in CFR across regions, and conclude that higher CFR observed by districts are largely related to the level of morbidity/infection rate, and therefore to a putative overwhelming of the local healthcare systems during the acute phases of the epidemic, rather than any deficiency or failure of the local healthcare. Moreover, they suggest the geographic differences are not due to population risk factors or reporting systems, which they purport are uniform across France. Interestingly, the CFR variation is small compared to much greater variation across countries reported in the literature, suggesting marked international inconsistency in case reporting and death ascertainment/coding. The manuscript is very thorough, well-illustrated through figures, with very strong statistical assumptions-based robust analysis, largely well-written, and an important contribution at a time such as this.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>1. Abstract. Final sentence / concluding idea &#x0201c;However, the magnitude of this increase of case-fatality rate represents less than 10 per cent of the average case-fatality rate&#x0201d; is incomplete and leaves the findings unexplained; I would expand and clarify.</p><p>2. Data analysis.</p><p>a. (Pg 17): &#x0201c;The observed gross hospital case-fatality rate calculated by district showed a mean of 0.153 with a standard deviation of 0.045 &#x02026; Without the Ile-de-France and Grand-Est regions, the mean gross case-fatality rate per district is 0.149 with a standard deviation of 0.048 (figure 6).&#x0201d; Given minimal change in mean CFR and SD by excluding the hardest hit areas, I don&#x02019;t understand why the authors persist in the analysis with / without these regions</p><p>b. (Pg 18): &#x0201c;The spatial distribution of standardized morbidity rate (hospitalized cases) shows a significant spatial autocorrelation (Moran index: 1.54, p-value &#x0003c; 10-6), and this is expected for an infectious disease.&#x0201d; I don&#x02019;t understand &#x0201c;autocorrelation&#x0201d; &#x02013; a parameter with itself, or a value in a region correlating with values around it?</p><p>c. (Pg 19): &#x0201c;There is a correlation between the standardized hospitalization rate and the standardized case-fatality rate (Bravais-Pearson index=0.40) (Figure 10), a correlation which increases (0.48) if we limit the calculation to districts whose SLR is significantly different from 1 (p-value &#x0003c; 0.05).&#x0201d; It is unclear which correlation result the p value refers to? Relatedly, p value should be provided in Fig 10 or its legend.</p><p>3. Figures/Tables. Some are poorly formatted, with small fonts, poorly explained terminology, and with some sloppiness (French labels from software that are not translated/explained)</p><p>a. Fig 1. Y-axis title &#x0201c;Effectifs&#x0201d; unexplained. Why are data in decimal format compared to % format in Table 1?</p><p>b. Fig 2. Y-axis titles illegible. X-axis title &#x0201c;Calendar&#x0201d; not clearfor a linear numerical scale.</p><p>c. Table 3. Each age group is assigned a % for the various parameters, but the totals are decimal (1.0) !</p><p>d. Fig 12. The legend terminology &#x0201c;1-5, H for 1-4&#x0201d; is completely unclear! The wording is clear but does not relate to &#x0201c;H&#x0201d;.</p><p>4. Discussion: Several concluding statements are unclear, and don&#x02019;t seem to be supported by data specifically presented in the Results. Moreover, much new data/analysis/calculations seem to be presented in the Discussion, which is inappropriate.</p><p>a. Pg 22: &#x0201c;the average case-fatality rate for all districts being about 15% higher than the average rate calculated in the 20% of districts with the lowest hospitalization rates&#x0201d; makes little sense. Moreover, the following conclusion &#x0201c;It is therefore very likely that the increase in hospital tension over the period under consideration has increased the hospital case-fatality rate&#x0201d; does not follow logically from the preceding.</p><p>b. Pg 23: &#x0201c;The first profile accounts for 60% of the patients (59,878 over 99,970). The case-fatality average for this profile is significantly higher (0.187) as compared with the other districts case-fatality average (0.138). The profile displays a 33% excess mortality, corresponding to 2,716 deaths (11,003 observed vs. 8,287 expected with the CFR 0.138). This excess mortality, corresponding to 16 % of all deaths, is likely to be the result of increased lethality due to overloading&#x02026;&#x0201d; presents much more data/analysis than in the Results. Similarly for the 2nd profile.</p><p>c. Pg 24: &#x0201c;WHO data from 219 countries (WHO 20) show a mean case-fatality rate of 0.041 (median 0.029, standard deviation 0.045) with values between 0.31 (Nicaragua) and 0.00 (for countries that did not report deaths, like Vietnam). A T-test shows that the French average is therefore very significantly higher than the world average (p-value &#x0003c; 10-6)&#x0201d;</p><p>d. Pg 25: &#x0201c;difference observed between the average case-fatality rate in France and the average of the rates reported for all countries by international organizations or information sites (WHO, Wordometer, etc.). These differences probably stem from the reporting of cases and deaths, which is uneven from one country to another, and not from the care or treatment of patients&#x0201d; appears to be an unsubstantiated conclusion. Because the variation if pandemic stress in some regions of France only explained 10% of the overall CFR variation, why does this exclude the possibility that differences in healthcare quality/access could explain differences across countries?</p><p>5. Conclusions. Given the changing population of France with north African and other immigration, could regional population differences not explain some differences in risk of severity of COVID and thus CFR variation? Moreover, regarding the variation in European countries, population and healthcare quality differences are much too easily dismissed: (Pg 10) &#x0201c;In Europe, the characteristics of populations (in terms of risk factor for COVID-19) and health systems are comparable &#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>6. References. I am very surprised given the complex geographic and statistical analysis that the reference list is so abbreviated ! It might be helpful to the average reader to perhaps have a few more to support the methodologic approaches, analysis, basics of healthcare statistics, etc.</p><p>Minor comments</p><p>1. Terminology.</p><p>a. Pg 16: &#x0201c;a cartographic representation by cartogram&#x0201d; should be revised.</p><p>b. Pg 21: &#x0201c;intensity of reanimation&#x0201d; is unclear.</p><p>c.

The manuscript entitled &#x0201c;COVID-19: Spatial Analysis of Hospital Case-Fatality Rate in France&#x0201d; by Souris and Gonzalez has studied the influence of the hospital care system on lethality in metropolitan France during the inception of the COVID-19 epidemic. The study concludes that the higher case fatality rates observed in France is linked to the level of morbidity in the district. The study has also suggested that the case-fatality rates (CFR) may be linked to the hospital care available in the district, i.e., higher congestion of the hospitals or lower accessibility of the hospital care leads to the higher CFR. The manuscript is well written, the introduction is quite informative, and the data are well presented and may be interesting for readers from varying fields. </p><p>Answer: We appreciate such positive comments and thank you for your consideration.</p><p>However, there are few concerns may be clarified are given below: </p><p>2. The abstract does not fully explain the study and needs to mention more about the findings presented in the discussion and conclusion.</p><p>Answer: The abstract has been completed as requested.</p><p>3. Higher hospitalization leads to higher CFR, this explains that it is directly related to the higher morbidity, however, to compare with the hospital care system authors need to present a data showing the number of hospital/ beds accessible (per 1000). As explained higher hospital stress means 3 or more per 1000 does not explain the availability or accessibility to hospital care. Table 4 shows the total hospitalized and CFR. Here authors may put a data comparing the hospital care accessibility.</p><p>Answer: </p><p>High hospitalization and therefore high morbidity should not lead to an increase in CFR, however one can think that excessive hospitalization (exceeding reception capacities) will potentially degrade hospital care. </p><p>The healthcare offer is designed to be evenly distributed in France: A table giving the number of beds per 100,000 inhabitants per region has been added, and the source of these data by departments. As it is indicated in the &#x0201c;results&#x0201d; section, there is no direct correlation between lethality and bed density, by department.</p><p>Accessibility does not only depend on the provision of care at regional or departmental level, but also depends on many other factors (e.g. socio-economic, behavioral, transport, rurality, etc.).</p><p>4. Table 4 also should show the data of hospitalized and death (%) 11 and 44 regions. This will help the readers to have better clarity.</p><p>Answer: The CFR for region 11 and 44 only has been added. However, the purpose of the study was to estimate the CFR by age group as a regular basis for the whole country, but not to analyze region 11 and 44 separately.</p><p>5. The higher CFR is among the age group 50 and above. Is the overall difference found between CFR whole and CFR without regions 11 and 44 is due to the presence of higher number of higher age group cases?</p><p>Answer: No, this is not true when the rate is age-standardized. In fact, the CFR estimate by age group for the whole country is used to standardize the rate on age by district, taking in account the population age structure of each district. </p><p>6. Table 4 shows that the CFR varies from 0.134 for districts with a low hospitalization rate (less than 0.5 per 1000) to 0.150 for districts with a high hospitalization rate (less than 4 per 1000). How the average for all the districts higher (0.152)? What is the meaning of districts number? What does &#x0201c;all&#x0201d; in the last line shows?</p><p>Answer: The table shows the increase of CFR with the increase of hospitalization rate. District number represent the cumulative number of districts corresponding to the hospitalization rate indicated in column 1.</p><p>7. Figure 12 presents districts with different morbidity and the lethality. Can the authors compare the low morbidity high lethality vs. high morbidity high lethality districts? Is there any similarity/ differences related to hospitalization/ accessible to hospitals or the aging population in these districts? The CFR is high in the higher age groups. To justify that the CFR is higher in the districts having higher hospital stress or due to lack of hospital care, authors need to show and compare the CFR rates between different age groups. Is the CFR is higher due to the presence of higher %age of higher age groups?</p><p>Answer: All rates are already age-standardized in order to take into account the difference of the age structure of a population between districts.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>8. The authors show the increase in the case-fatality rate in France during epidemic peaks related to the level of morbidity, but not from the care or treatment of patients during hospital stress due to epidemic peaks. Although this paper was well written, I have several comments. Sufficient improvements for those issues are needed for the acceptance to the PLoS One.</p><p>Answer: Yes, this true, only the case-fatality rate in France are presented during the epidemic peaks associated to the level of morbidity, by districts, but this is not an analysis done from the care or treatment of patients.</p><p>9. I believe that morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 are strongly related to patient&#x02019;s factors including incidence of diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Please indicate the difference of these risk factor between France and other countries or regions in France, or if there is no data, please indicate as a limitation.</p><p>Answer: In this study, the difference in CFR between districts in France is analyzed, and the magnitude of this difference is evaluated in order to compare it with the difference observed with CFR in other countries. The major observed risk factor for COVID-19 mortality is age, so the data has been age-standardized to exclude this factor as a potential difference between districts. Other risk factors for severity and mortality have been also observed for COVID-19, including among others: hypertension; cardiovascular disease history; diabetes; obesity. When trying to find another risk factor for SLR variation (as hospital congestion for example), it would also be useful to standardize on these health risk factors in order to eliminate differences in risk between districts. Unfortunately, apart for age, we do not have the necessary data to evaluate, for these risk factors or combinations of factors, the populations concerned (by districts) and the global case-fatality rates due to COVID-19 for each factor or a combination of factors. Even if these risk factors are also related to age, this is a limitation, and such appears now in the methods and discussion section.</p><p>10. In our country, there are differences in the availability of infectious disease wards and the capacity to operate ECMO depending on the region. Please explain differences of these factors between France and other countries or regions in France, or if there is no data please explain in the discussions and limitations.</p><p>Answer: As indicated in the section 8 (Q/A) above, our study analyzes the data reported by district without any clinical data on treatment or patient care at the hospital level. I our knowledge, no specific data on ECMO (Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) capacity by district is available in France (only at the hospital level and not reported at the national level). By district, no data were available on treatment or care of patients (only for the intensive care units), therefore it was not possible to analyze the differences in lethality by referring to the patient treatment. This kind of analysis can be possible at the hospital level (providing such capacity) and eventually allow analyzing CFR differences between hospitals. But this will be another type of an interesting study.</p><p>11. Criteria of severity of COVID-19 by admitting ICU or not depend on capacity of each facility, so I concern that it may be inappropriate as an indicator of the severity. I consider that there is no correlation between the severity rate and the case-fatality rate. I believe that endotracheal intubation is relatively good indicator of the severity of the disease. Is it possible to discuss the difference in the severity of cases according to this standard and the difference from other countries?</p><p>Answer: We agree with the comment of the reviewer. In fact, we think that in France ICU admission for COVID patients means most of the time, respiratory distress followed by endotracheal intubation. However, as a criteria of severity of COVID-19 by admitting ICU or not depend not only on the capacity of each facility (some have high capacity and generally before and after the epidemic pic) but also on the criteria (score) used by the ICU team to evaluate the patient (e.g. NEW2) and also depends on the country. Unfortunately, we don&#x02019;t have access to such type of data for other countries. In this article, we use &#x0201c;severity&#x0201d; based only the rate of resuscitation measures or endotracheal intubation.</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>12. Souris et al present a very unique and interesting analysis of the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization in France, specifically analyzing hospital case-fatality rate to try to understand regional/geographic variations in healthcare. They report significant variations in CFR across regions, and conclude that higher CFR observed by districts are largely related to the level of morbidity/infection rate, and therefore to a putative overwhelming of the local healthcare systems during the acute phases of the epidemic, rather than any deficiency or failure of the local healthcare. Moreover, they suggest the geographic differences are not due to population risk factors or reporting systems, which they purport are uniform across France. Interestingly, the CFR variation is small compared to much greater variation across countries reported in the literature, suggesting marked international inconsistency in case reporting and death ascertainment/coding. The manuscript is very thorough, well-illustrated through figures, with very strong statistical assumptions-based robust analysis, largely well-written, and an important contribution at a time such as this.</p><p>Answer: We appreciate the point of view of the reviewer and entirely agree with this overview of our work. Thank you.</p><p>13. Abstract. Final sentence / concluding idea &#x0201c;However, the magnitude of this increase of case-fatality rate represents less than 10 per cent of the average case-fatality rate&#x0201d; is incomplete and leaves the findings unexplained; I would expand and clarify</p><p>Answer: As above mentioned, the abstract has been entirely revised accordingly to the positive suggestion and comments by the reviewers.</p><p>14. Data analysis.</p><p>a. (Pg 17): &#x0201c;The observed gross hospital case-fatality rate calculated by district showed a mean of 0.153 with a standard deviation of 0.045 &#x02026; Without the Ile-de-France and Grand-Est regions, the mean gross case-fatality rate per district is 0.149 with a standard deviation of 0.048 (figure 6).&#x0201d; Given minimal change in mean CFR and SD by excluding the hardest hit areas, I don&#x02019;t understand why the authors persist in the analysis with / without these regions</p><p>Answer: Indeed, the difference is not very significant, but it seemed to us more rigorous to standardize on age with overall rates estimated without a possible increase due to a possible saturation of the care system.</p><p>b. (Pg 18): &#x0201c;The spatial distribution of standardized morbidity rate (hospitalized cases) shows a significant spatial autocorrelation (Moran index: 1.54, p-value &#x0003c; 10-6), and this is expected for an infectious disease.&#x0201d; I don&#x02019;t understand &#x0201c;autocorrelation&#x0201d; &#x02013; a parameter with itself, or a value in a region correlating with values around it?</p><p>Answer: Yes, spatial autocorrelation measures the correlation of a value with the values around it and reflect the spatial pattern of a phenomenon. References has been added.</p><p>c. (Pg 19): &#x0201c;There is a correlation between the standardized hospitalization rate and the standardized case-fatality rate (Bravais-Pearson index=0.40) (Figure 10), a correlation which increases (0.48) if we limit the calculation to districts whose SLR is significantly different from 1 (p-value &#x0003c; 0.05).&#x0201d; It is unclear which correlation result the p value refers to? Relatedly, p value should be provided in Fig 10 or its legend.</p><p>Answer: The p-value refers to the significance of the SLR to be different from 1, i.e. the district showing statistically significant excess or default of SLR. The correlation can be calculated over all districts, or only over the districts that show statistically significant excess or default lethality.</p><p>15. Figures/Tables. Some are poorly formatted, with small fonts, poorly explained terminology, and with some sloppiness (French labels from software that are not translated/explained)</p><p>Answer: All French labels has been translated accordingly. All figures and tables have been revised.</p><p>a. Fig 1. Y-axis title &#x0201c;Effectifs&#x0201d; unexplained. Why are data in decimal format compared to % format in Table 1?</p><p>Answer: Corrected</p><p>b. Fig 2. Y-axis titles illegible. X-axis title &#x0201c;Calendar&#x0201d; not clear for a linear numerical scale.</p><p>Answer: Corrected</p><p>c. Table 3. Each age group is assigned a % for the various parameters, but the totals are decimal (1.0) !</p><p>Answer: Corrected</p><p>d. Fig 12. The legend terminology &#x0201c;1-5, H for 1-4&#x0201d; is completely unclear! The wording is clear but does not relate to &#x0201c;H&#x0201d;.</p><p>Answer: Corrected</p><p>16. Discussion: Several concluding statements are unclear, and don&#x02019;t seem to be supported by data specifically presented in the Results. Moreover, much new data/analysis/calculations seem to be presented in the Discussion, which is inappropriate.</p><p>a. Pg 22: &#x0201c;the average case-fatality rate for all districts being about 15% higher than the average rate calculated in the 20% of districts with the lowest hospitalization rates&#x0201d; makes little sense. Moreover, the following conclusion &#x0201c;It is therefore very likely that the increase in hospital tension over the period under consideration has increased the hospital case-fatality rate&#x0201d; does not follow logically from the preceding.</p><p>Answer: We reformulate and clarified the sentence.</p><p>b. Pg 23: &#x0201c;The first profile accounts for 60% of the patients (59,878 over 99,970). The case-fatality average for this profile is significantly higher (0.187) as compared with the other districts case-fatality average (0.138). The profile displays a 33% excess mortality, corresponding to 2,716 deaths (11,003 observed vs. 8,287 expected with the CFR 0.138). This excess mortality, corresponding to 16 % of all deaths, is likely to be the result of increased lethality due to overloading&#x02026;&#x0201d; presents much more data/analysis than in the Results. Similarly for the 2nd profile.</p><p>Answer: We have chosen to place these results in the discussion because they are part of the analysis of the different profiles we are proposing, which are more a matter of discussion than of results per se.</p><p>c. Pg 24: &#x0201c;WHO data from 219 countries (WHO 20) show a mean case-fatality rate of 0.041 (median 0.029, standard deviation 0.045) with values between 0.31 (Nicaragua) and 0.00 (for countries that did not report deaths, like Vietnam). A T-test shows that the French average is therefore very significantly higher than the world average (p-value &#x0003c; 10-6)&#x0201d;</p><p>Answer: We moved this paragraph to the &#x0201c;results&#x0201d; section.</p><p>d. Pg 25: &#x0201c;difference observed between the average case-fatality rate in France and the average of the rates reported for all countries by international organizations or information sites (WHO, Wordometer, etc.). These differences probably stem from the reporting of cases and deaths, which is uneven from one country to another, and not from the care or treatment of patients&#x0201d; appears to be an unsubstantiated conclusion. Because the variation if pandemic stress in some regions of France only explained 10% of the overall CFR variation, why does this exclude the possibility that differences in healthcare quality/access could explain differences across countries?</p><p>Answer: The healthcare system in France is renowned for being of good quality, in terms of equipment, medical staff, patient care and treatment. COVID-19 patient management protocols in France do not differ significantly from those used in other European countries (Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece, etc.). It is therefore unlikely that the huge differences in lethality are due to differences in management or quality of care. But our conclusion concerns the possible degradation of care during periods of hospital stress (epidemic pic, ward and medical worker overload): the results indicate that this observed degradation, even substantial, cannot explain the difference in case-fatality rate with other countries, some of which have themselves experienced periods of hospital stress (e.g. Italy, Spain, UK, Mexico, Brazil).</p><p>17. Conclusions. Given the changing population of France with north African and other immigration, could regional population differences not explain some differences in risk of severity of COVID and thus CFR variation? Moreover, regarding the variation in European countries, population and healthcare quality differences are much too easily dismissed: (Pg 10) &#x0201c;In Europe, the characteristics of populations (in terms of risk factor for COVID-19) and health systems are comparable &#x02026;&#x0201d;.</p><p>Answer: Official data collection and statistics on ethnic origin of population are prevented in France. </p><p>18. References. I am very surprised given the complex geographic and statistical analysis that the reference list is so abbreviated! It might be helpful to the average reader to perhaps have a few more to support the methodologic approaches, analysis, basics of healthcare statistics, etc.</p><p>Answer: Several references have been added accordingly.</p><p>19. Terminology.</p><p>a. Pg 16: &#x0201c;a cartographic representation by cartogram&#x0201d; should be revised.</p><p>Answer: &#x0201c;Cartogram&#x0201d; is the specific name of this king of map, in which some thematic variable is substituted for land area or distance.</p><p>b. Pg 21: &#x0201c;intensity of reanimation&#x0201d; is unclear.</p><p>Answer: we change to &#x0201c;the differences in use of resuscitative measures or endotracheal intubation&#x0201d;</p><p>c. Pg 22: &#x0201c;Hospital tension&#x0201d;</p><p>Answer: we change to &#x0201c;high medical admission rates and healthcare workers stress&#x0201d;</p><p>Dear Editor, we thank you for your kind consideration of our reviewed manuscript.</p><p>Dr. Marc Souris</p><p>Dr. Jean-Paul Gonzalez</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0243606.s001"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0243606.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0243606.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0243606.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Adrish</surname><given-names>Muhammad</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Muhammad Adrish</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Muhammad Adrish</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0243606" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

</p><p>Please find below our answer addressing the comments raised by the reviewer.</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>R#3- Unresolved concern: The crux of the paper is that &#x0201c;epidemic stress&#x0201d; leading to some degradation of care explains only a small proportion of the variation in CFR across French regions. However, the authors have not clearly discussed or speculated what is the major reason for this huge variation in lethality! Moreover, their statements of &#x0201c;good quality&#x0201d; of French care and similar patient management protocols across European countries ignores the reality of medical care at the frontline or on the ground, where much variation occurs based on local administrations, local facilities, as well as local populations. Their response is inadequate.</p><p>Answer: </p><p>When we refer strictly to the data, the standard deviation of the case-fatality rate between French departments is 4.5%, for a case-fatality rate that averages 15.3%. Our results show that these variations are directly related to the level of morbidity in the department, and cannot be explained by possible differences between departments in the COVID-19 assumed risk factors for lethality (age, cardiovascular history, hypertension, diabetes, obesity). </p><p>Independently of the causes of the internal spatial variability of lethality in France, we therefore find that this internal spatial variability is too low to explain the significant differences with the rates published for many other countries: the differences in mean lethality between countries cannot be explained either by the differences in morbidity between countries, or by the differences in lethality risk factors between countries, or by the differences in inpatient treatment (at the global mean level. We certainly do not ignore the existing disparities in the reality of the field, but in this study, it is not a question of going into detail at the granular level of the hospital).</p><p>As we write in the article, the most likely explanation for these strong differences in lethality between countries is therefore the disparities in the reporting of cases and deaths. This explanation is confirmed with the publication of studies on excess mortality, which show that most countries have a deficit of deaths (not enough COVID-19 deaths reported to explain excess mortality compared to previous years), while some countries, including France and Belgium, have a slight excess of COVID-19 deaths (too many COVID-19 deaths reported compared to excess mortality compared to previous years).</p><p>In order to clarify our point, we have added these few remarks to the end of the discussion (p. 21) and added references to the studies mentioned above.</p><p>R#3-Unresolved concern: This limitation should be recognized/stated in the manuscript, but is not an excuse for lack of scientific consideration by the authors of this important basis for some of the regional / country differences. This point should be considered/discussed even in the absence of any specific data being available.</p><p>Answer :</p><p>Indeed, our answer was probably incomplete. </p><p>Beyond the technical difficulty of invoking ethnic differences or standardizing on this variable (due to lack of data), we consider that ethnic, religious, cultural factors are confounding factors (in the epidemiological sense of the term), in that they can influence the COVID-19 risk factors of lethality (e. g. co-morbidities, access to care, late recourse to care) but are not directly risk factors of lethality themselves: data on lethality risk factors related to the health status of individuals are available, and we already had added a paragraph on this issue in the last revision of the manuscript (page 15 in the Results section). </p><p>Recent studies on excess mortality in March-April 2020 show differences (globally over France) according to the geographical origin of birth of the deceased (but beware: it is not known whether the death is attributable to COVID-19). These differences show an excess of excess mortality among individuals born abroad, particularly in Africa and Asia. The authors of these studies attribute this excess of excess mortality due to COVID-19 to the spatial distribution of this population, which is much more present in densely populated areas, particularly in the Ile-de-France region, and which has therefore been proportionally more affected by the epidemic. These studies concern morbidity and mortality, not lethality, and do not suggest any risk factors for lethality specific to this population.

</p><p>Please find below our answers addressing the comments raised by the reviewer#4.</p><p>1) The concrete results in the manuscript include spatial autocorrelation of certain variables, a positive correlation between hospitalization rate and case-fatality rate, and a &#x0201c;weak&#x0201d; negative correlation between hospitalization rate and severity rate. However, there is concrete data and rigorous analysis to support one point the authors tried to stress&#x02014;non-comparability of case-fatality rates across countries. Therefore, statements on this point should at most be kept in Discussion and removed from Abstract (the 4th paragraph) and Introduction (the 4th paragraph).</p><p>Answer: we removed the statement of the introduction (effectively it is a result of our study), but we think that it can be kept as a result in the abstract. We move the statement at the end of the abstract to clearly show it as a conclusion.</p><p>2) The exact definition of age standardized case-fatality rate is still unclear. In the formula in page 4, are P[a] and T[a] district specific or not? If they are, there should be subscript i; if not, that means the expectation E is the same in all the district of the France, which is the so-called &#x0201c;average rate for France&#x0201d;? It is unclear whether the district observed case fatality rate was age adjusted or not? My understanding is yes according to the term &#x0201c;district&#x02019;s SLR&#x0201d;; however, what&#x02019;s the formula for it? As I pointed out, the only formula so far is not district specific.</p><p>Answer: Indirect age standardization use case-fatality rates by age group a (Ta) calculated over the whole country, and not district specific, but Pa,i is the population of age group a in the district i. The subscript i was missing for Pa,i. We corrected this error, and we thank the reviewer to have highlighted this error in the formula.</p><p>3) The language is verbose and many contents are superfluous. I suggest shortening the manuscript, removing unnecessary parts, and making only succinct points. Take an example, the whole page 4 seems can be removed.</p><p>Answer: we agree that the manuscript is long, but we think that explanations on lethality and its different factors are required to better understand the article (as noted positively by the other reviewers).</p><p>4) The last sentence of the second paragraph in Introduction&#x02014;&#x0201c;&#x02026;, unlike case-fatality rates, which are normally calculated independently of the number of infected persons&#x0201d;&#x02014; it is confusing to me, how the case-fatality rate could be independent of the number of infected persons? Isn&#x02019;t it the denominator? </p><p>Answer: The sentence meaning is: the case-fatality rate is independent of the extend of the disease in the population. We removed the sentence to avoid confusion.</p><p>5) I confirm that all the data used in this study is fully available, as indicated in the article.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0243606.s003"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers_3.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0243606.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0243606.r007" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0243606.r007</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 3</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Adrish</surname><given-names>Muhammad</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Muhammad Adrish</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Muhammad Adrish</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj007" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0243606" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
